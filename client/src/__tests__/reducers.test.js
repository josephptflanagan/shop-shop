//A reducer is a function that updates state by returning a new state object
// and never alters the original state object. Now, that doesn't mean the data
// inside the state object isn't altered. Of course, it isâ€”why else would we
// need to update state? The key takeaway here is that state is intended to
// be immutable, meaning it never should be directly altered in any way.
// The reason for this is that it goes behind the state management system's
// back and it isn't informed that something has changed. 

// import our reducers
import { reducer } from '../utils/reducers';

// import our actions
import {
    UPDATE_PRODUCTS,
    UPDATE_CATEGORIES,
    UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY
  } from '../utils/actions';
  
  // create a sample of what our global state will look like
  const initialState = {
    products: [], //New state created with UPDATE_PRODUCTS
    categories: [{ name: 'Food' }], //New state created with UPDATE_CATEGORIES
    currentCategory: '1',//New state created with UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY
  };

  //A Reducer accepts 2 parameters, the current state object, the action being 
  // performed to update the state.
  //The action is composed of two parts: type,the type of action being performed, 
  // and value, the new data we want to use with the action

  // it's two objects in length, while ensuring the original object is unchanged
