//A reducer is a function that updates state by returning a new state object
// and never alters the original state object. Now, that doesn't mean the data
// inside the state object isn't altered. Of course, it isâ€”why else would we
// need to update state? The key takeaway here is that state is intended to
// be immutable, meaning it never should be directly altered in any way.
// The reason for this is that it goes behind the state management system's
// back and it isn't informed that something has changed. 

//The useState() Hook is great for managing simpler amounts of state, like form field values and the status of a button
// being clicked. The useReducer() Hook is meant specifically for managing a greater level of state, like we're doing now.
